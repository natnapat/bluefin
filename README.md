# Personal Budget and Portfolio

This project is my final year project. It is a mobile application developed using Flutter to do following things: <br />
  1. Enabled user to monitor charts, PNL, income and expense.
  2. Enabled user to add statements and assets(cryptocurrency).
  
APIs: <br />
  1. [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) <br />
  2. I'm using an AWS lambda function to provide a list of supported assets. <br />
For help getting started with Flutter, [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Paper is provided in repo. <br />
